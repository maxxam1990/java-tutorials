   PROBLEM: A teacher has been implementing some new teaching methods. His students just took their MIDTERM exam and the professor has finished grading them.
   He wants to know if the student's scores reflect positive results or negative results by getting a count of how many students got an A, B, C, D, or F. 
   
   CONDITIONS: - The number of students in the classroom will be entered by the user.
     		   - The user will enter the scores of each student.
     		   - The program will follow a regular grading criteria to assign letter grades:
     		     >> A is between 91 and 100
     		     >> B is between 81 and 90
     		     >> C is between 71 and 80
     		     >> D is between 61 and 70
     		     >> F is less than 60
